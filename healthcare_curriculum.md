Health Data Research UK has a number of useful courses and videos about working with health data. For example Accessing Health Data (requires a login, 1 hour) explains the regulatory framework and Trusted Research Environment.
If you are not sure whether what you are doing is research, or what kind of research it is and whether you need ethical approval, you can view the HRA guidelines (15 minutes) and definitions and you can use their decision making tool. 
If what you are working on is classed as research, you should complete NIHR training, from this webpage there is a link to create an account on NIHR learn and complete a course on 'Good Clinical Practice' (requires a login, 4 hours). Despite its name, this course is about conducting clinical research to an agreed international standard. This is really important to ensure that the data are reliable and reproducible and also to safeguard the people taking part in research. 
This framework has been implemented in response to a long history of poorly conducted research that has resulted in avoidable or deliberate harm coming to participants such as Tuskegee Syphilis Study.

### Why This Matters
You should already have completed information governance training before accessing NHS data. Before you start analysing any data, it is important to understand where the data have come from, what type of data it is and what consent has been given for you to analyse it. This is because you may be dealing with confidential patient data or other data of a sensitive nature.
